# Linear-Regression-Without-Sklearn
This Python script uses the `seaborn` library to create a pair plot. It visualizes relationships between variables in the `penguins` dataset, including "species," "bill_length_mm," "bill_depth_mm," "flipper_length_mm," "sex," and "body_mass_g." The plot helps analyze patterns and distributions in the data.
